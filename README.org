* cargo-transient
cargo-transient provides a [[https://github.com/magit/transient][transient]] interface for [[https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo][cargo]].
** Usage
~M-x cargo-transient~

By default, all commands will share the same compilation buffer, but that can be changed by customizing ~cargo-transient-compilation-buffer-name-function~.
** Supported Commands
- ~build~
- ~check~
- ~clean~
- ~clippy~
- ~run~
- ~test~

Not all commands and arguments are supported. If cargo-transient is missing support for something you need, please [[https://github.com/peterstuart/cargo-transient/compare][open a pull request]] or [[https://github.com/peterstuart/cargo-transient/issues/new][file an issue]].
